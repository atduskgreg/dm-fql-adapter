An FQL Adapter for DataMapper. Read-only.

FQL is the "Facebook Query Language": an API that allows you to send SQL-ish strings along with session information and API credentials to Facebook in order to query for information about users, comments, stream activity and more. See the FQL docs here: http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/FQL

For usage see example_app.rb.

As of 7/16/09, this only ran on the DataMapper Next branch (i.e. 0.10). For details on how to upgrade to that branch, see here: http://sick.snusnu.info/2009/06/03/migrating-to-datamapper-0100/
